Automated tests
    - code that runs your code with various inputs and compares those inputs to the expected output
    - unit tests - functions that test your functions
        - super specific to one function
        - isolated from the rest of the application
        - specific to one function (one piece of functionality)
    - end-to-end test (integration) 
        - use selenium/webdriver/pupetteer to automate a browser
        - write instructions to the browser automation tool
            - go to https://codeup.com
            - login w/ good credentials
            - assert that I logged in appropriately
            - attemp to login with bunk credentials 
            - asserts that the login was unsuccessful
        - testing an entire feature 
        - test the entire application
    - Test Driven Development (TDD)
        - write the test before the code
        - write one test for one function/feature at a time
        - given that failing test, write just enough code to make the test pass
